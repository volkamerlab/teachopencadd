    "Adapted from [Pagadala, Syed & Tuszynski, Biophysical Reviews 2017, 9, 2, 91–102](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12551-016-0247-1):\n",

    "> Molecular docking methodology explores the behavior of small molecules in the binding site of a target protein. The applied software performs a search algorithm in which the conformation of the ligand is evaluated recursively until the convergence to the minimum energy is reached. Finally, an affinity scoring function, ΔG (U total in kcal/mol), is employed to rank the candidate poses as the sum of the electrostatic and van der Waals energies. The driving forces for these specific interactions in biological systems aim toward complementarities between the shape and electrostatics of the binding site surfaces and the ligand or substrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "These scoring functions are tailored to be fast to compute, and thus their accuracy is often poorer than in other molecular modeling methods. Normally, they are based on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Molecular mechanics principles\n",
    "- Knowledge-based potentials\n",
    "- Shape and geometric complementarity\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the search space dimensionality, some approximations are often applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The protein structure is considered mostly rigid, with maybe some side chains in the vicinities of the search area allowed to explore a limited set of conformations (rotamers).\n",
    "- The ligand can be considered rigid in virtual screening studies, but it is often allowed to freely explore its bond torsions in more detailed calculations. A compromise between both options is defining a set of probable conformations beforehand.\n",

    "### Known limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The following approximations could introduce artifacts in the calculation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Since the protein is mostly rigid, the dynamic, adaptive nature of the protein-ligand binding is barely explored. This can result in some false positives: even if the ligand finds a suitable pose in the binding pocket, this position is not guaranteed until the protein is allowed to explore near-minima conformations. In other words, short molecular dynamics trajectories are always recommended to check that the ligand stays in the binding pocket.\n",
    "- The scoring function must be cheap to resolve. While the accuracy is good enough to distinguish good poses from bad poses, it can have problems sorting the best poses. For example, while most popular docking programs are able to find the experimental pose in their calculations, this pose is rarely the best one of the proposed set.\n",
    "- To reduce the computational cost, docking procedures are only performed in a subset of the protein (normally around a known binding pocket). Choosing the correct binding pocket becomes then another question in the CADD pipeline. \n",
    "- To leverage the accuracy of the calculation, the structures must be reduced accordingly. Protonation states of amino acids and the ligands can be tricky to get right, especially in the case of (potential) tautomers. This introduces yet another cause to obtain wrong results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite all these limitations, docking calculations are still popularly used in all pharma laboratories, along with other types of molecular simulation. In this part of the talktorial we will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare the protein and ligands obtained in part A  (locally)\n",

The recommended approach is using the preparation scripts present in [AutoDockTools](http://autodock.scripps.edu/resources/adt). Although these tools are distributed on their own, and are only compatible with Python 2, we have prepared a [Python 3-ready fork](https://github.com/jaimergp/autodocktools-prepare-py3k) containing the subset needed for protein and ligand preparations. This should be enough for our needs.\n",

    "> Automated prediction of protein active sites is essential for large-scale protein function prediction, classification, and druggability estimates. In this work, we present DoGSite, a new structure-based method to predict active sites in proteins based on a Difference of Gaussian (DoG) approach which originates from image processing. In contrast to existing methods, DoGSite splits predicted pockets into subpockets, revealing a refined description of the topology of active sites. DoGSite correctly predicts binding pockets for over 92% of the PDBBind and the scPDB data set, being in line with the best-performing methods available. In 63% of the PDBBind data set the detected pockets can be subdivided into smaller subpockets. The cocrystallized ligand is contained in exactly one subpocket in 87% of the predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a more precise prediction performance measure by taking the pairwise ligand and pocket coverage into account. In 90% of the cases DoGSite predicts a pocket that contains at least half of the ligand. In 70% of the cases additionally more than a quarter of the respective pocket itself is covered by the cocrystallized ligand. Consideration of subpockets produces an increase in coverage yielding a success rate of 83% for the latter measure."

    "> Biomedical applications have become increasingly complex, and they often require large-scale high-performance computing resources with a large number of processors and memory. The complexity of application deployment and the advances in cluster, grid and cloud computing require new modes of support for biomedical research. Scientific Software as a Service (sSaaS) enables scalable and transparent access to biomedical applications through simple standards-based Web interfaces. Towards this end, we built a production web server (http://ws.nbcr.net) in August 2007 to support the bioinformatics application called MEME. The server has grown since to include docking analysis with AutoDock and AutoDock Vina, electrostatic calculations using PDB2PQR and APBS, and off-target analysis using SMAP. All the applications on the servers are powered by Opal, a toolkit that allows users to wrap scientific applications easily as web services without any modification to the scientific codes, by writing simple XML configuration files. Opal allows both web forms-based access and programmatic access of all our applications. The Opal toolkit currently supports SOAP-based Web service access to a number of popular applications from the National Biomedical Computation Resource (NBCR) and affiliated collaborative and service projects. In addition, Opal's programmatic access capability allows our applications to be accessed through many workflow tools, including Vision, Kepler, Nimrod/K and VisTrails. From mid-August 2007 to the end of 2009, we have successfully executed 239,814 jobs. The number of successfully executed jobs more than doubled from 205 to 411 per day between 2008 and 2009. The Opal-enabled service model is useful for a wide range of applications. It provides for interoperation with other applications with Web Service interfaces, and allows application developers to focus on the scientific tool and workflow development.

    "OPAL offers a Vina installation to perform docking calculations for free, but we have to prepare the input files locally before the submission. Part of that preparation involves defining the search area, normally around a known binding site. Instead of guessing visually, we have used the DoGSiteScorer server present in Proteins.plus to calculate the origin and radius of the most probable binding site. These two services used different communication interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Proteins.plus uses REST, but does not provide a `swagger.json` definition as KLIFS did, so we had to build our own requests manually. Fortunately, the service is simple enough to *only* need a couple of requests... or so we thought! The current API does not allow for custom PDB uploads, so we had to use a handful of GET and POST requests to pretend we were using a normal browser. To guess the correct requests, the Network tab in Chrome Developer Tools was really handy. If you ever need to reverse engineer a webservice, this is one of the tools you can use!\n",
    "\n",
    "OPAL is built with the XML-based SOAP standard, a bit more cumbersome than JSON-based REST, but `suds` makes it really easy. Although `suds` will report the available methods, these are not very well documented. Fortunately, there are some code examples scattered in some modules of [UCSF Chimera](http://plato.cgl.ucsf.edu/trac/chimera/browser/trunk/libs/WebServices/opal_client.py). Jobs submitted to OPAL are public once you have the job ID and the files are updated in realtime, so we could build a live preview of the calculation output by querying the server every N seconds and updating the `display()`ed HTML dynamically. This trick can also be used to query a calculation happening in your machine: all you need to do is read the file contents, clear the current output and display the new one as an `HTML()` object (see function `iprint()`).\n",

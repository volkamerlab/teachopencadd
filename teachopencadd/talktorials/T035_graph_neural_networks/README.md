## Aim of this talktorial
In this tutorial, we will first explain the basic concepts of graph neural networks (GNNs) and present two different GNN architectures. We apply our neural networks to the `QM9` dataset, which is a dataset containing small molecules. With this dataset, we want to predict molecular properties. We demonstrate how to train and evaluate GNNs step by step using PyTorch Geometric.

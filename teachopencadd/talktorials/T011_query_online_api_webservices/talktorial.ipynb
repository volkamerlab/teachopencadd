    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Internet is a collection of connected computers that exchange data. In a way, you essentially query machines (servers) with certain parameteres to retrieve specific data. That data will be either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **A**. Served straight away, since the server is simply a repository of files (e.g. you [download the ChEMBL database dump](ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/chembl/ChEMBLdb/latest/) from their servers).\n",
    "- **B**. Retrieved from a database and formatted in a particular way. The result you see on your browser is either:\n",
    "    - **B1**. Pre-processed on the server (e.g. the HTML page you see when you visit any [article in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_design)).\n",
    "    - **B2**. Dynamically generated on the client (your browser) as you use the website (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, or any modern _web-app_).\n",
    "- **C**. Computed through the execution of one or more programs on the server-side (e.g. estimating the protonation states of a protein-ligand complex via [Protoss](https://proteins.plus/help/tutorial)). \n",
    "\n",
    "> In a way, configuration C is a special type of B1. You are just replacing the type of task that runs on the server: database querying and HTML rendering _vs_ arbitrary computations that process your query and return data formatted in a domain-specific way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of categorizing online services is by the _format_ of data returned. Most pages you see on your browser are using HTML, usually focusing on presenting data so it is human-readable. However, some servers might structure that data in a way that is _machine_-readable: this data can be processed in a reliable way because it's formatted using a consistent set of rules that can be easily encoded in a program. Such programs are usually called _parsers_. HTML can be labeled in such a way that data can be obtained reliably, but it is not designed with that purpose in mind. As a result, we will usually prefer using services that provide machine-readable formats, like JSON, CSV or XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, both ways of data presentation (should) coexist in harmony. Modern web architecture strives to separate data retrieval tasks from end-user presentation. One popular implementation consists of using a programmatic endpoint that returns machine-readable JSON data, which is then consumed by the user-facing web application (which renders HTML, either on the server -option B1-, or on the user's browser -option B2). Unfortunately, unlike the user-facing applicatino, the programmatic endpoint (API) is not guaranteed to be publicly available, and is sometimes restricted to internal usage in the server side.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we will discuss how to make the most out of each type of online service using Python and some libraries!"

    "Modern web services are able to provide standardized ways to access their data, especially when it comes to databases. This usually means that you can access a specific URL in their site to request results that are __machine readable__.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) is a database for all types of information concerning proteins. If you look for a specific protein, like `Src` (involved in cancer), you will arrive at [this beautiful webpage](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P12931) with well organized content sections. If you add `.fasta` to the URL, however, you will obtain the protein sequence in `FASTA` format.\n",

    "This is a way to provide programmatic access to a web service: through specific URL schemes. However, each web service would have to come up with their own scheme, which will force the developers to implement their scripts on a case-by-case basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are some standardized ways to provide this kind of programmatic access:\n",
    "\n",
    "- HTTP-based RESTful APIs ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Applied_to_Web_services))\n",
    "- GraphQL\n",
    "- SOAP\n",
    "- gRPC\n",
    "\n",
    "In this talktorial, we will only use REST and SOAP APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### HTTP-based RESTful APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of programmatic access/provision defines a specific entry point for clients (scripts, libraries, programs) that require programmatic access, something like `api.webservice.com`. They can be versioned, so the provider can update the scheme without disrupting existing implementations (`api.webservice.com/v1` will still work even when `api.webservice.com/v2` has been deployed).\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of APIs is usually accompanied by well-written documentation explaining all the available actions in the platform. For example, look at the [GitHub REST API for listing repositories](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/#list-organization-repositories). You can see how every argument and option is documented, along with usage examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only difficulty is to build the needed URLs in the correct way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://api.github.com/users/volkamerlab/repos\n",

Instead, you will have to use the regular webpage and parse through the HTML code to obtain the information you need. This is called (web) __scraping__, which usually involves finding the right HTML tags and IDs that contain the valuable data (ignoring things such as the sidebars, top menus, footers, ads, etc).\n",

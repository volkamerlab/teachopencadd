## Aim of this talktorial

Researchers often focus on prediction quality alone. However, when applying a predictive model, researchers are also interested in how certain they can be in a specific prediction. Estimating and providing such information is the goal of uncertainty estimation. In this talktorial, we discuss some common methodologies and showcase ensemble methods in practice.

Binding Site,Definition Method,detection,"Definition method for the protein binding site. Allowed: 'coordinates', 'ligand', 'detection'. Default: detection"
Binding Site,Coordinates,,"If Definition Method is 'coordinates', enter the coordinates here. The coordinates should be entered as six numbers separated by spaces in the following order: center_x center_y center_z size_x size_y size_z."
Binding Site,Ligand,,"If the Definition Method is 'ligand', enter the ligand-ID (as specified in the PDB file) here."
Binding Site,Detection Method,dogsitescorer,"If the Definition Method is 'detection', enter the detection method here. Allowed: 'dogsitescorer'. Default: dogsitescorer"
Binding Site,Protein Chain-ID,,"If the Definition Method is 'detection', optionally a specific chain-ID can be given here, so that detection is only performed on that chain alone."
Binding Site,Protein Ligand-ID,,"If the Definition Method is 'detection', optionally a specific ligand-ID present in the PDB file can be given here, so that the ligand coverage is also considered in the detection results."
Binding Site,Selection Method,sorting,"If the Detection Method is 'dogsitescorer', a selection method should be specified in order to select the best detected binding site. Allowed: 'sorting', 'function'. Default: sorting."
Binding Site,Selection Criteria,"lig_cov, poc_cov","If the Selection Method is 'function', a valid Python function manipulating the detection results should be entered here. If the Selection Method is 'sorting', a list of binding-site properties to sort the detected binding-sites should be entered here. For more details see the Supplementary Information chapter of the notebook. Default for 'sorting': lig_cov, poc_cov. Default for 'function': (df['drugScore'] + df['simpleScore']) / df['volume']."

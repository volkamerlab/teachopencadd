## Aim of this talktorial

This talktorial is supposed to serve as an introduction to machine learning on point cloud representations of molecules with 3D conformer information, i.e., molecular graphs that are embedded into Euclidean space (see **Talktorial 033**). You will learn why Euclidean equivariance and invariance are important properties of neural networks (NNs) that take point clouds as input and learn how to implement and train such NNs. In addition to discussing them in theory, this notebook also aims to demonstrate the shortcomings of plain graph neural networks (GNNs) when working with point clouds practically.

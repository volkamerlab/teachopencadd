    "Let us just take this statement by Laplace as the ideological substrate underneath molecular dynamics simulations. In other terms, we can approximate the behavior of a physical system by knowing the characteristics of its components and applying Newton's laws of motion. By solving the equations of motion, we can obtain a molecular trajectory of the system, which is a series of snapshots with the positions and velocities of all its particles, as well as its potential energy. To do so, we define functions, called force fields, which provide an approximate description of all the forces applied to each particle in the system. We then use numerical integrators to solve the initial value problem for the system and obtain the trajectory. As it sounds, the process requires quite a bit of processing power and it was only few years ago that MD started seeing a more widespread use, especially in the field of computational chemistry and biology, as well as in drug discovery ([_J Med Chem_ (2016), **59**(9), 4035‐4061](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01684))."

    "Often, molecular systems are simulated in a box filled with solvent such as water. These boxes are of finite size, which results in problems for molecules at or near the box boundaries. With which molecules should those interact? Periodic boundary conditions can avoid such boundary artifacts by simulating a theoretically infinite system. Molecules at one boundary of the box thereby interact with molecules at the boundary on the other side of the box. This mimics a situation, in which the simulation box is surrounded by replicas of itself. When visualizing such MD simulations, one can often observe that particles leave the box at one side (Fig. 3). However, they re-appear at the same time on the other side of the box with the same velocity. For simulations under periodic boundary conditions, it is recommended to use a simulation box large enough, so that the simulated macromolecule does not come into contact with neighboring images of itself."

    "MD simulations give valuable insights into the highly dynamic process of ligand binding to their target. When a ligand (or a drug) approaches a macromolecule (protein) in solution, it encounters a structure in constant motion. Also, ligands may induce conformational changes in the macromolecule that can best accommodate the small molecule. Such conformations may not be discovered with static methods. Accordingly, binding sites that are not observed in static ligand-free structures, but can be discovered with MD simulations, are sometimes called *cryptic binding sites* ([_J Med Chem_ (2016), **59**(9), 4035‐4061](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01684)). The identification of such binding sites with MD simulation can kickstart new drug discovery campaigns. Later in the drug discovery process, MD simulations can also be used to estimate the quality of computationally identified small molecules before performing more costly and time-intensive *in vitro* tests. Altogether, MD simulations pose a valuable asset in computational drug design."

It is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular receptor domain and an intracellular kinase domain. The binding of the endogenous ligand epidermal growth factor results in activation of the kinase domain via dimerization and autophosphorylation.

    "\n",
    "A crucial part for successful simulation is a correct and complete system. Crystallographic structures retrieved from the Protein Data Bank often miss atoms, mainly hydrogens, and may contain non-standard residues. In this talktorial, we will use the python package [PDBFixer](https://github.com/openmm/pdbfixer) to prepare the protein structure. However, co-crystallized ligands are not handled well by [PDBFixer](https://github.com/openmm/pdbfixer) and will thus be prepared separately."

[MDTraj](https://github.com/mdtraj/mdtraj) can handle the prepared protein, which is currently a [PDBFixer](https://github.com/openmm/pdbfixer) molecule, a format that has a topology and atom positions similar to and usually interchangeable with [OpenMM Modeller](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application.html#model-building-and-editing) topologies and positions. For the ligand however, we need to do several conversions, since it is currently an [RDKit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit) molecule."

    "We have successfully performed an MD simulation of a protein ligand complex. However, we simulated only a considerably short time to keep the execution time of the talktorial short. To address critical questions in drug design, longer simulations are often required.  \n",
    "MD simulations are still too computationally costly to be useful for this purpose. Thus, so-called enhanced sampling methods were developed, that aim to accelerate the conformational sampling. Some of the most common methods are discussed in the **Further reading** section below.   \n",
    "Furthermore, we did not include an equilibration step, which is commonly used to slowly heat up the system from 0 to 300 K before starting the simulation and might be important when simulating more sensitive systems including lipid bilayers. The protonation of ligand and protein was done separately, which is suboptimal, since protonation states of protein residues and ligand affect each other. However, we did not find a free and open-source solution meeting all requirements. Suggestions are very welcome!  \n",

    "### Enhanced sampling methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, unbiased MD simulations should be capable of simulating binding and unbinding events of a drug molecule and its macromolecular target. However, the timescale of binding and unbinding events lies in the millisecond to second range. Enhanced sampling methods aim to accelerate the conformational sampling ([_J Med Chem._ 2016, **59(9)**, 4035-61](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.5b01684)).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of these is **Free energy perturbation (FEP)** (also called alchemical free energy calculation), which computes the free energy difference when going from a state A to another state B. It is often employed in lead optimization to evaluate small modification at the ligand, that may boost the binding affinity for the desired target. The ligand from state A is thereby gradually transformed into the ligand of state B by simulating several intermediate (\"alchemical\") states ([alchemistry](http://www.alchemistry.org/wiki/Main_Page)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another technique for free-energy calculations is **Umbrella sampling (US)**. US enforces sampling along a collective variable (CV) by performing staged simulations with an energetic bias. The bias usually takes the form of a harmonic potential, hence the term \"umbrella\". Its goal is to sample high-energy regions along the CV. However, the use in drug design is limited by the high computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **Steered MD (SMD)** follows a different approach: it applies external forces to the system. Those forces are time-dependent and facilitate the unbinding of the ligand from the target. The SMD calculates the final force exerted on the system. The unbinding force profile can then be used to filter hits from docking calculations and to discriminate active from inactive molecules."

## Aim of this talktorial

Molecular representation by a SMILES string paved the way for applying natural language processing techniques to a broad range of molecule-related tasks. In this talktorial we will dive deeper into one of these techniques: recurrent neural networks (RNNs). First, we will describe different RNN architectures and then apply them to a regression task using the QM9 dataset.

    "Depending on the given data, e.g., no protein-ligand complex structure (x-ray) is available or one is interested in allosteric sites, binding site detection algorithms come into play. Binding sites, or in the case of enzymes rather called active sites, are cavities in 3-dimensional space, mostly on the surface of a protein structure, that serve as binding (docking) regions for ligands, peptides, or proteins. To interact with each other, the two binding partners need to be complementary concerning shape and physico-chemical properties (*key and look* principle).\n",

If the ligand is absent, prediction tools can be used for *in silico* pocket detection. These methods can be grouped on the one hand in geometry- and energy-based methods as well as on the other hand in grid-based and grid-free approaches, as outlined in Figure 2. Note that in recent years, more and more machine or deep learning based methods have been developed (see e.g. [DeepSite](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx350) by Jiménez *et al.*, Bioinformatics, 2017, 33(19), 3036–3042)."

    "\n",
    "* *Geometric, grid-based approach*: In [**LIGSITE**](https://doi.org/10.1016/s1093-3263(98)00002-3) (Hendlich, *et al.*, J Mol Graph Model., 1997, 15(6):359-63, 389), a Cartesian grid (e.g. 1Å grid spacing) is spanned over the protein of interest. Each grid point is then scanned in seven direction (along the x, y and z axes as well as the four cubic diagonals) and the number of Protein-Solvent-Protein (PSP) events per point is stored (# rays restricted on both side by the protein). Finally, grid points that are buried (= have a high PSP value) are clustered to pockets.\n",
    "* *Geometric, grid-free approach*: In [**SURFNET**](https://doi.org/10.1016/0263-7855(95)00073-9) (Laskowski, J Mol Graph., 1995, 13(5):323-30, 307-8), spheres are placed midway between all pairs of atoms on the protein surface directly. In case a probe clashes with any nearby atom, its radius is reduced until no overlap occurs. The resulting probes define the cavities.\n",
    "* *Energy, grid-based approach*: In [**DrugSite**](https://doi.org/10.11234/GI1990.15.2_31) (An, *et al.*, Genome Informatics, 2004, 15(2): 31–41), the protein is embedded in a Cartesian grid and carbon probes are placed on each grid point. Then, van der Waals energies between the probe and the protein environment within 8 Å distance are calculated. Grid points with unfavorable energies, i.e., above an energy cut-off based on the mean energy and standard deviation over the whole grid, are discarded. Finally, grid points fulfilling this cut-off are merged to pockets.\n",
    "* *Energy, grid-free approach*:  In **docking**-based methods, fragments (or small molecules) are docked against the protein of interest (placed and scored, for more info on docking see talktorial T015). Pockets are then assigned based on the quantity of fragments that bind to a specific area."

    "In this talktorial, we will use the DoGSiteScorer functionality, available within [protein.plus](https://proteins.plus/), to detect and score the pockets of a protein of interest. Thus, the algorithm will be explained in a bit more detail (see Figure 3 for a visual explanation).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Pocket detection*: DoGSiteScorer incorporates a **geometric** and **grid-based** algorithm to detect pockets. The protein is embedded in a Cartesian grid, and each grid point is labeled as either 0 (free) or 1 (occupied), depending on if it lies within any protein atom's van der Waals radius. Then, an edge-detection algorithm from image processing, a **Difference of Gaussian filter** (thus the name DoGSite) is invoked to identify protrusion on the protein surface (i.e. the positions on a protein surface where the location of a sphere-like object is favorable). Based on specific cut-off criteria, grid points with the highest intensity are selected and first clustered to subpockets, then merged to pockets. \n",
    "* *Descriptor calculation*: Based on the grid representation of the respective pocket as well as the surrounding protein atoms, properties describing the pocket are derived. These include properties such as volume, surface, or depth of the pocket (calculated directly from the properties of the individual grid points) as well as hyprophobicity, number of available hydrogen bond donors/acceptors or amino acid count (derived from the neighboring protein residues).  \n",
    "* *Druggability estimates*: Additionally, the tool has an in-built druggability predictor. [Druggability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druggability) can be defined as the ability of a (disease-associated) target to bind - and potentially be modulated by - low molecular weight compounds (sometimes also referred to as ligandability). In DoGSiteScorer, druggablity is predicted using a support vector machine (SVM) model, trained and tested on the freely available (non-redundant) druggability data set (NR) DD. The DD consists of 1069 targets and each target was assigned to one of the three classes: druggable, difficult, or undruggable. \n",

The curated KLIFS data allows systematic analyses of all kinase structures and binding sites, bound ligands and protein-ligand interactions. KLIFS comes with a nomenclature of typical structural motifs within kinases (such as DFG-in/out, hinge region, ...) and maps the binding site of all known kinases to 85 residues, defined via an elaborated multiple sequence alignment. It is possible to compare the interaction patterns of kinase-inhibitors to each other to, for example, identify crucial interactions determining kinase-inhibitor selectivity. \n",

    "We introduced the idea of binding site detection algorithms using DoGSiteScorer, which can be queried through the [proteins.plus](https://proteins.plus) server.\n",
    "Besides investigating into the main (known) binding site, as exemplified above, one can use other predicted pockets to initiate drug design campaigns against a novel, e.g. allosteric or less explored, pocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential shortcomings: Such algorithms detect the pockets based on a given protein structure (x-ray). If another structure of the same protein is available, applying the algorithm to that structure might lead to (slightly) different pockets due to e.g. conformational changes induced by the bound ligand. Also differences between apo and holo structures do affect the predictions."

Here, we discuss SMILES, InChI, and SELFIES. For a deeper dive, we refer the reader to the SMILES talktorial [T035 · SMILES based property prediction](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd/tree/master/teachopencadd/talktorials)\n",
    "\n",
    "**SMILES** (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry Specification) is the most widely used text-based representation and can be handled by all common frameworks. When we specify a molecule in RDKit, we often use SMILES notation (more on this in the practical part): \n",

    "`mol = Chem.MolFromSmiles(\"CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C\") `\n",

    "SMILES can also represent the [chirality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)) of a molecule. This is possible by specifying the relative angle of a bond for an atom. We will see an example in the practical part.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem with SMILES for molecule representation is that two (or more) different SMILES strings might refer to the same molecule. Researchers try to circumvent this by resorting to a **canonical SMILES** notation. However, the canonicalization depends on the canonicalization algorithms and is therefore not standardized. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the other direction, a single SMILES string typically identifies no more than one molecule. However, when stereochemistry information is not given in the SMILES string, it leaves room for ambiguity (in some cases, it might not even be possible to remove all ambiguity for different molecular configurations). \n",

    "**Point clouds:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already established that molecules are three-dimensional objects. So why not directly use a computational representation that captures the 3D information? The most straightforward way to do this is to annotate the nodes/atoms in a molecular graph with Euclidean 3D coordinates $(x,y,z)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial arrangement of atoms is called **molecular configuration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of equipping a graph with 3D coordinates, one can also disregard the information on chemical bonds as [this paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=pjePBJjlBby) claims:\n",
    "> The covalent bonds between atoms do not need to be encoded explicitly because they are attributed by the overlap between the atomic orbitals, and can be inferred from the types and 3D coordinates of respective atoms. In principle, the point-based representation captures the complete structural information about the molecule, and thus serves as the adequate input for molecular representation learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**SE(3)-invariance:** \n",
    "When equipping the atoms of a molecule with their (absolute) 3D position, we have a similar problem as with the node ordering in the previous section.\n",
    "Instead of \"*Which node ordering do we choose?*\" We now have to ask \"*How do we position the molecule in 3D to measure the atom positions?*\".\n",
    "As in the node-ordering case, it is difficult (if not impossible) to give a principled answer to this question.\n",
    "The solution is again to restrict ourselves to neural networks that are invariant to translations (move the whole molecule in $x$, $y$, or $z$ direction) or rotations of the molecule.\n",
    "Neural networks (or functions in general) that can guarantee that the output is not affected by translations and rotations are called **SE(3)-invariant**.\n",
    "One example of architecture can be found [here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/15231a7ce4ba789d13b722cc5c955834-Paper.pdf).\n",
    "One possibility to design SE(3)-invariant neural networks is to consider only the distance between all pairs of atoms instead of their absolute position. This leads not only to SE(3)-invariance but to a broader class called **E(3)-invariance**. This is because also reflections (mirror images) are guaranteed to produce the same output. For molecules, this might be suboptimal because mirror molecules can exhibit different properties (see chirality). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Determining configurations:** \n",
    "When you want to add 3D coordinates to atoms, you first need to find them somehow. This is not straightforward, and one can even train a machine learning model to predict this. \n",
    "One possibility is to determine the configuration experimentally.\n",
    "For small molecules, [techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_geometry#Determination) like diffraction methods can be used.\n",
    "For proteins, [other techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding#Experimental_techniques_for_studying_protein_folding), like X-ray crystallography, are available.  \n",
    "Alternatively, one can resort to computational methods.\n",
    "For instance, the popular dataset [QM9](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1) provides 3D coordinates of each atom that were computed using [DFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory) (an approximation to the Schrödinger equation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conformers:**\n",
    "However, another problem of the point cloud perspective on molecules is that there is not a single, fixed configuration for a molecule. Instead, molecules are dynamic objects.\n",
    "**Molecular conformers** are different configurations that a molecule can take due to rotations around single bonds (double and triple bonds are non-rotatable). These conformations are a result of the rotational energy barriers that exist between different groups of atoms within a molecule. Conformations can change quickly and easily, e.g., in response to changes in temperature.\n",
    "Note that conformers are a special type of isomers. Not all isomers can be reached by rotating single bonds. \n",

    "\n",
    "Each specific conformer is associated with a conformation energy.\n",
    "The likelihood of a specific configuration depends on this energy (low-energy configurations are more likely than high-energy configurations). Specifically, we typically observe local minima. \n",
    "When representing a conformer, one might also store the torsion angles at rotatable bonds instead of the 3D position of each atom (as done [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01776.pdf)).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SE(3)-invariant machine learning models are not invariant to bond rotations. \n",

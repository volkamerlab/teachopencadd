    "One possibility to specify a graph is with an adjacency matrix $A$.\n",

    "The fact that we need to pick a node ordering to represent a molecule as a graph means that many graphs represent the same molecule. \n",

    "We call neural networks (or functions in general) that have these guarantees (node-)permutation invariant (or equivariant for node-level outputs).\n",

If both were given, permutation invariance and the ability to produce a different output for all non-isomorphic graphs, our neural network would solve the graph isomorphism problem (which is computationally extremely difficult).

    "**Point clouds:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already established that molecules are three-dimensional objects. So why not directly use a computational representation that captures the 3D information? The most straightforward way to do this is to annotate the nodes/atoms in a molecular graph with Euclidean 3D coordinates $(x,y,z)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial arrangement of atoms is called **molecular configuration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of equipping a graph with 3D coordinates, one can also disregard the information on chemical bonds as [this paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=pjePBJjlBby) claims:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The covalent bonds between atoms do not need to be encoded explicitly because they are attributed by the overlap between the atomic orbitals, and can be inferred from the types and 3D coordinates of respective atoms. In principle, the point-based representation captures the complete structural information about the molecule, and thus serves as the adequate input for molecular representation learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**SE(3)-invariance:** \n",
    "When equipping the atoms of a molecule with their (absolute) 3D position, we have a similar problem as with the node ordering in the previous section.\n",
    "Instead of \"*Which node ordering do we choose?*\" We now have to ask \"*How do we position the molecule in 3D to measure the atom positions?*\".\n",
    "As in the node-ordering case, it is difficult (if not impossible) to give a principled answer to this question.\n",
    "The solution is again to restrict ourselves to neural networks that are invariant to translations (move the whole molecule in $x$, $y$, or $z$ direction) or rotations of the molecule.\n",
    "Neural networks (or functions in general) that can guarantee that the output is not affected by translations and rotations are called **SE(3)-invariant**.\n",
    "One example of architecture can be found [here](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/15231a7ce4ba789d13b722cc5c955834-Paper.pdf).\n",
    "One possibility to design SE(3)-invariant neural networks is to consider only the distance between all pairs of atoms instead of their absolute position. This leads not only to SE(3)-invariance but to a broader class called **E(3)-invariance**. This is because also reflections (mirror images) are guaranteed to produce the same output. For molecules, this might be suboptimal because mirror molecules can exhibit different properties (see chirality). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Determining configurations:** \n",
    "When you want to add 3D coordinates to atoms, you first need to find them somehow. This is not straightforward, and one can even train a machine learning model to predict this. \n",
    "One possibility is to determine the configuration experimentally.\n",
    "For small molecules, [techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_geometry#Determination) like diffraction methods can be used.\n",
    "For proteins, [other techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding#Experimental_techniques_for_studying_protein_folding), like X-ray crystallography, are available.  \n",
    "Alternatively, one can resort to computational methods.\n",
    "For instance, the popular dataset [QM9](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1) provides 3D coordinates of each atom that were computed using [DFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory) (an approximation to the Schrödinger equation).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conformers:**\n",
    "However, another problem of the point cloud perspective on molecules is that there is not a single, fixed configuration for a molecule. Instead, molecules are dynamic objects.\n",
    "**Molecular conformers** are different configurations that a molecule can take due to rotations around single bonds (double and triple bonds are non-rotatable). These conformations are a result of the rotational energy barriers that exist between different groups of atoms within a molecule. Conformations can change quickly and easily, e.g., in response to changes in temperature.\n",
    "Note that conformers are a special type of isomers. Not all isomers can be reached by rotating single bonds. \n",

    "\n",
    "Each specific conformer is associated with a conformation energy.\n",
    "The likelihood of a specific configuration depends on this energy (low-energy configurations are more likely than high-energy configurations). Specifically, we typically observe local minima. \n",
    "When representing a conformer, one might also store the torsion angles at rotatable bonds instead of the 3D position of each atom (as done [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01776.pdf)).\n",

    "**Practical considerations:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Building a molecular graph requires the labeling of nodes and edges.\n",
    "Common frameworks support this.\n",
    "For machine learning, [PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the most popular framework for building permutation-invariant neural networks. \n",
    "We provide a demonstration in **Talktorials T035/T036**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting a SMILES string or RDKit object to a PyTorch Geometric graph is not complicated, but somewhat technical. One possible implementation is explained [here](https://www.blopig.com/blog/2022/02/how-to-turn-a-smiles-string-into-a-molecular-graph-for-pytorch-geometric/).\n",
    "Similarly, one can create a networkX graph as explained [here](https://gist.github.com/fangkuoyu/dc785218e5d4d94c752e80f1aaba4fad).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you see, molecular graph representations are not standardized and leave a lot of **design choices** to the user.\n",
    "These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the node features? Only the atom type, or also information on chirality? One can also include the information if the atom is part of a ring. \n",
    "- For the edge features: Do you only include the bond type (single, double, triple) or also the bond length? Do you use one-hot encodings or scalars?\n",
    "- Do you want to include hydrogen atoms that are bound to carbon atoms, or leave them out?\n",
    "- Do you want to add a master node (a dummy atom connected to all other atoms)? It might help some ML algorithms.\n",
    "- Do you want to explicitly indicate some substructures in the molecular graph?\n"

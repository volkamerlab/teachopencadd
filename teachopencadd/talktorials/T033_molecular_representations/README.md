__Talktorial T033__: This talktorial is part of the TeachOpenCADD pipeline described in the TeachOpenCADD publication, consisting of Talktorials T033 to T038.


## Aim of this talktorial

In this talktorial, we conduct the groundwork for the deep learning talktorials.
Specifically, we learn about molecular representations and find that representing a molecule in a computer is not a trivial task. Different representations come with their specific implications and (dis-)advantages.

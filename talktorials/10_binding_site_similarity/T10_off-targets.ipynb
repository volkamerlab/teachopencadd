    "### Off-target proteins\n",
    "\n",
    "An off-target can be any protein which interacts with a drug or (one of) its metabolite(s) without being the designated target protein. \n",
    "The molecular reaction caused by the off-target can lead to unwanted side effects, ranging from a rather harmless to extremely harmful impact. \n",
    "Off-targets mainly occur because on- and off-targets share similar structural motifs with each other in their binding site and therefore can bind similar ligands. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Computational off-target prediction: binding site comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Computation-aided prediction of potential off-targets is aimed at minimizing the risk of developing potentially dangerous substances for medical treatment.\n",
    "There are several algorithmic approaches to assess binding site similarity but they always consist of three main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Binding site encoding**: binding sites are encoded using different descriptor techniques and stored in a target database.\n",
    "2. **Binding site comparison**: a query binding site is compared with the target database, using different similarity measures.\n",
    "3. **Target ranking**: targets are ranked based on a suitable scoring approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed information on different similarity measures and existing tools, we refer to two excellent reviews on binding site comparison ([<i>Curr. Comput.

    "### Pairwise RMSD as simple measure for similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple and straightforward method for scoring the similarity is to use the calculated root mean square deviation (RMSD), which is the square root of the mean of the square of the distances between the atoms of two aligned structures ([Wikipedia: RMSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation_of_atomic_positions)). \n",
    "\n",

    "If these kinases are constitutively active (due to genomic mutations), they can distort regulation processes and cause cancer.\n",
    "An example for cancer treatment is Imatinib ([<i>Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol.</i> (2016), <b>13</b>, 431-46](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrclinonc.2016.41)), a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat cancer, more specifically chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). \n",
    "\n",
    "Imatinib was shown to be not entirely specific and to target tyrosine kinases other than its main target. This was used for drug repositioning, i.e. Imatinib was approved for alternate cancer types, ([<i>J. Biol.</i> (2009), <b>8</b>, 10.1186/jbiol134](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2689438/)), however can also show unwanted side effects such as signs of an allergic reaction, infection, bleeding, or headache ([Drugs.com: Imatinib](https://www.drugs.com/cdi/imatinib.html))."

    "In this talktorial, we have used sequence alignment and subsequent RMSD refinement of whole protein structures and binding sites to assess the similarity and dissimilarity of a set of Imatinib-binding proteins. \n",
    "However, off-target prediction for Imatinib requires to compare the binding site of an intended target of Imatinib (a tyrosine kinase) with a large database of resolved structures (PDB). \n",
    "Since this results in the comparison of sequences also with low similarity, more sophisticated methods should be invoked\n",
    "that use a sequence-independent alignment algorithm and that include the physico-chemical properties of the binding site in order to enable a more sophisticated search.\n",

    "1. Explain the terms on- and off-targets of a drug.\n",
    "2. Explain why binding site similarity can be used to find off-targets to a query target.\n",
    "3. Discuss how useful the RMSD value of (i) whole proteins and (ii) protein binding sites is for off-target prediction.\n",
    "4. Think of alternate approaches for binding site information (how to encode a binding site for binding site comparison?)."
